Files related to experiment of acceleration of Marker-In-Cell (MIC) based geodynamic models origionally
presented by T.Gerya in 1st edition of 'Introduction To Numeric Geodynamics' (2009).
The intention of these files is to check if Pyhton's porting is faster than original Matlab implementation
and to what extent Cython and Just-in-time technologies could accelerate the code.
